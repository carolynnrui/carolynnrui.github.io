 <center><h1>CSP Ice Cream Shop!<h1><center>
<center><img src="images/119project.png" height = "500"><center>
<p>Here is a picture of my 1.1.9 Project, which shows the ice cream customization game my team and I created! It asks the user many questions, like "What is your name? and "How many scoops of ice cream would you like?" The code then takes all this inputted information and creates a customized ice cream sundae with dozens of possibilities. There are three different flavors of icecream-chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry-as well as two different flavors of sauce-caramel or strawberry. At the end, the user can even put a cherry on top if they'd like.</p>

<center><h1>Tic Tac Toe!<h1><center>
<center><img src="images/125project.png" height = "500"><center>
<p>Here is a picture of my 1.2.5 Project, which involved making a game of some kind. After spending the unit learning how to code the specifics of game-related operations, we used our knowledge to create a regular "Tic Tac Toe" game between two players, A and B. The text box takes input from two players all while displaying their movements on the screen through a 3x3 box of red O's and blue X's. We used many defined functions and nested loops to create the game and recognize the various inputs of the game. At the end, the game recognizes if the game is a draw or a win and asks the players if they want to play again!</p>

<center><h1>Hangman!<h1><center>
<center><img src="images/hangman.png" height = "500"><center>
<p>Here is a picture of my 1.3.1 Project, which involved creating a game of some sort that included both color and animation, or a moving component. We decided to make a game of hangman, which allows two people to play the classic game on a computer that takes one person's inputted word and allows the other to guess it. We used many functions and lists to get the code to recognize the users' words and guesses. Our moving component took place in a pencil gif that we animated to draw the different body parts and we designed the whole thing as though it were happening on a piece of paper!</p>

<center><h1>Choose Your Own Adventure!<h1><center>
<center><img src="images/scratchproject.png" height = "500"><center>
<p>As an introduction to the coding platform of Scratch, I made a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game, in which you play as the main character, a dog named Doug, who is lost and needs your help finding his way back home. Throughout the game, Doug faces you with multiple decisions, in which you will have to decide where to go next. Using several background changes and nested loops to command different scenes depending on different choices, I coded a world where Doug and the user go on an adventure together that is determined fully by the user's choices. Spoiler, Doug finds his owner at a surprise birthday party at the end!</p>
