<p>Here is a picture of our 1.1.9 Project, which shows the ice cream customization game my team and I created! It asks the user many questions, like "What is your name?" and "How many scoops of ice cream would you like?" The code then takes all this inputted information and creates a customized ice cream sundae with dozens of possibilities. There are three different flavors of icecream-chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry-as well as two different flavors of sauce-caramel or strawberry. At the end, the user can even put a cherry on top if they'd like.</p>
