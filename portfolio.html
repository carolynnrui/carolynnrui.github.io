<p style="font-size:10vw">Here is a picture of my 1.1.9 Project, which shows the ice cream customization game my team and I created! It asks the user many questions, like "What is your name? and "How many scoops of ice cream would you like?" The code then takes all this inputted information and creates a customized ice cream sundae with dozens of possibilities. There are three different flavors of icecream-chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry-as well as two different flavors of sauce-caramel or strawberry. At the end, the user can even put a cherry on top if they'd like.</p>

<center><h1>Tic Tac Toe!<h1><center>
<center><img src="images./125project.png" height = "500"><center>
<p style="font-size:10vw">Here is a picture of my 1.2.5 Project, which involved making a game of some kind. After spending the unit learning how to code the specifics of game-related operations, we used our knowledge to create a regular "Tic Tac Toe" game between two players, A and B. The text box takes input from two players all while displaying their movements on the screen through a 3x3 box of red O's and blue X's. We used many defined functions and nested loops to create the game and recognize the various inputs of the game. At the end, the game recognizes if the game is a draw or a win and asks the players if they want to play again!</p>
